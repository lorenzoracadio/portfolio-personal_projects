[Project Overview]

Title: Effects of Educational Attainment and on Family Size

Summary: Fertility rates are declining around the world (Bongaarts and Hodgson, 2022) and while there are multiple factors, this brief study analyzes the relationship of
educational attainment of the household head (hereinafter referred to as educational attainment) on family size using data from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES)
conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) in 2017. For convenience, a standard OLS regression, and some preceding tests, was used.

The research determines that
1. There is a statistically significant but very weak negative correlation between educational attainment and family size.
2. Based on the results and visual observation, family size decreases as educational attainment increases

For future studies, one recommendation could be to look at changes in the data over a period of a few years.

Skills Used: Statistical Analysis using Python packages (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels)
